# SteavenGamerYT's Wallpaper Collection
Possibly the most common question I get from pepole on Discord is "Hey, can you give me a link to your wallpaper?"  Well, I have collected these wallpapers over a number of years and have no idea where I got most of them.  I have also renamed them all (giving them a number) so I don't even have their original filename.  So I am uploading my entire wallpaper directory for those that want/need them.

# Where Did I Get These?
I find wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include [WallpaperFlare](https://wallpaperflare.com) and [WallpaperAccess](https://wallpaperaccess.com).  Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions that I have installed over the years.

# Ownership
Because I downloaded most of these from sites like Imgur and /wg/, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
